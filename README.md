# EdgeUcation
This is a blog I am creating to help Computer Science students. It will work as a forum for student only to discuss issues and get homework help from their peers. It will also feature interview prep questions once fully completed.
I am currently in the process of converting it to version 1.10 because 1.9 isunsafe and not supported by django anymore.
I'm using python 2.7, sublime text as my text editor.

NOTE: I have left out a couple of python libraries and initial set up to get to this point.
